# English_Romans

A project to learn some basic QGIS skills by analysing data on the Romans.

This project uses QGIS 3 to import data obtained from the Archaelogy Data Service which contains the location of 3.6k dig sites in Endgland (specifically England, not the UK).  The purpose of the project is to find out which areas of England have the most Roman finds.
